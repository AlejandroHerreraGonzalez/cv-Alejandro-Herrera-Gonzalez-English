## Alejandro Herrera Gonzalez

I am a self taught lover of programing and artificial intelligences with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and a special taste for challenge. At this point my best achivement was to be able to create a artificial intelligences that could self taught without the interbention of a human been. I am looking for a job that challenge my knowledge of artificial intelligences with the support of an interdisciplinary group in an environment that encourages constant and rapid change.
